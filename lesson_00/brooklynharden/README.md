## About ME

## Hobbies

* I love books, I am open any genres - except fantasy, with the exception of <i>Twilight.</i> You should follow my GoodReads @brukie. I post my reviews, which can be brutally honest but it's only because I feel as if literature has declined in quality. It seems authors aren't passionate about their craft anymore.

* Drawing & Painting, you can also follow my art instagram @brooklynartss. I dont tend to draw as much anymore but I still love doing it.

* Tv & Movies, I watch a lot of TV. Name any movie-trust me, I've definitely have watched it
