# My Tech Stack

I prefer coding in C#, Python, and Typescript, but I can also use similar languages in regards like Java, Javascript and others. These main 3 coding languages cover a good basis of what things I like to create and develop. They will be listed below in order:

1. Game Development: C# and Unity
1. AI & Machine Learning: Python, PyTorch and TensorFlow
1. Full Stack Development: Typescript & Javascript, React, Angular and Vue

I also made different variations of these tech stacks, such as a game using Python and a Python library that allowed GUIs. In general, I like app, game, and web development and the act of creating something, even if its in turns of artificial intelligence!
